# Project Name

Replace this text with a synopsis of the library.

## Motivation

Explain why this library exists and what problems it solves.

## Requirements

Add a link to requirements file or system

## Download

Include instructions on how to integrate the library into your projects. For instance install in your build.gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {

}
```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use and integrate the library into a project.

If there's some special pieces for testing (ie Mocks) explain those here as well.

### Logs

This library uses [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) for logging. Please use android binding to
log into logcat. More info on [Android binding](http://www.slf4j.org/android/)

```groovy
dependencies {
    // https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-android
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-android:1.7.30'
}
```

You can also bind SLF4J to timber. In this case please use this dependency

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.arcao:slf4j-timber:3.1'
}
```

To activate verbose logging, please add this into your code :

```java
LogDefines.setVerbose(true);
```

Sometimes, it can have log for profiling, in this case, to activate them please add
this in code :

```java
LogDefines.setProfile(true);
```

One `TAG` is used for all logging from lib. It would be easy to filter on this tag if you
want to disable all logging from lib. Filtering can be done with `Timber` and a `Tree`
from [Treessence](https://github.com/bastienpaulfr/Treessence)


```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.bastienpaulfr:Treessence:1.0.5'
}
```
